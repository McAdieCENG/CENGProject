### November 5, 2019
Finished with soldering my PCB with all my components, and have uploaded the pictures to the [images folder](https://github.com/McAdieCENG/CENGProject/tree/master/Images). Currently, as far as my budget, project plan, purposal and schedule I am on track with completing my project without having to make changes to my budget or my project plan. At this point in time, I have assembled and completed all required steps and process to have my project ready for PCB power up next week. I will continue to test my development platform connection with my sensor to make sure everything is working like it should. Below are pictures of my finsihed PCB.
