## Introduction
Welcome to the build guide for the BME680 sensor to use in devolpment with a greenhouse system. The scope of this project is to learn and integrate a piece of hardware with the broadcomm development platform. In our case, we will be using a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ as our platform to integrate with the BME680 sensor. All of which can then be used for real world applications such as the stated greenhouse system. Below is an image of a finished version of this project.

These products are what I used to complete this project, some or all products may not be required if you already have access to them or wish to use a supliment product inplace of the ones I have used. ***Keep in mind, as a student I was able to aquire my PCB board and 3D printed case for FREE as part of my tuition. These items will need to be aquired by a 3rd party supplier or manufacturer to complete this build and will most likly cost a small fee.**
