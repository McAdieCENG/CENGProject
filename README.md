## Introduction
Welcome to the build guide for the BME680 sensor to use in devolpment with a greenhouse system. The scope of this project is to learn and integrate a piece of hardware with the broadcomm development platform. In our case, we will be using a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ as our platform to integrate with the BME680 sensor. All of which can then be used for real world applications such as the stated greenhouse system. Below is an image of a finished version of this project.
