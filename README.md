## Introduction
Welcome to the build guide for the BME680 sensor to use in devolpment with a greenhouse system. The scope of this project is to learn and integrate a piece of hardware with the broadcomm development platform. In our case, we will be using a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ as our platform to integrate with the BME680 sensor. All of which can then be used for real world applications such as the stated greenhouse system. Below is an image of a finished version of this project.

These products are what I used to complete this project, some or all products may not be required if you already have access to them or wish to use a supliment product inplace of the ones I have used. **Keep in mind, as a student I was able to aquire my PCB board and 3D printed case for FREE as part of my tuition. These items will need to be aquired by a 3rd party supplier or manufacturer to complete this build and will most likly cost a small fee.**

## Time Commitment
This project ran its course over an entire school semester (4 months, ~15 weeks). The average time per week spend working on this project including class time, was around ~5 hours. With an average understanding of computers and hardware assembly, I would estimate that the time to potentially complete this project would be around 7-8 hours. That being said, I have made this estimate based on the fact that you should have all or most of the required parts at the time of production. Please be advisded of shipping times when ordering parts or materials, some products may be coming from over seas and require longer time to arrive. A full schedule break down for my time used over the school semester can be found [here.](https://github.com/McAdieCENG/CENGProject/blob/master/Documentation/Schedule%20Files/CENG317Schedule-pages-deleted.pdf)

## Mechanical Assembly
Raspberry Pi Setup:
When it comes to setting up your Raspberry Pi for this build there are a few quick tutorials online that can help you through this portion of the build. The first tutorial can be found at this [link here.](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/raspberry-pi-setting-up) After completing the initial setup of the Pi following the first link, you can use [this link](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/vnc/README.md) to set up the Pi to accept a remote desktop connection through a program called VNC viewer. It may also be a good idea to enable I2C, you can follow this [link here](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-4-gpio-setup/configuring-i2c) to get that done. After completing these few tutorials you can power down your Raspberry Pi for now as we do not need it quite yet.
